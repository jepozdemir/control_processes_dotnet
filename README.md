![Launching and Controlling Processes in C# .NET](/cover.png "Launching and Controlling Processes in C# .NET")

This repository contains code samples and techniques referenced in my Medium blog post, ["How to Launch and Control Processes in C# .NET Applications"](https://medium.com/@jepozdemir/how-to-launch-and-control-processes-in-c-net-applications-4ae6565410d6). This post and repository focus on executing, managing, and interacting with system processes in .NET applications.

## Overview
In this blog post, I explore how to launch and control external processes using C# and the .NET framework. The `System.Diagnostics.Process` class provides a powerful way to start, monitor, and manage external programs from within a C# application.

### Topics Covered

- **What Is Process in .NET?**  
  Explanation of how C# applications can interact with system processes.

- **Launching a Process in C#**  
  Demonstration of how to start an external process using the `Process.Start` method.

- **Reading Process Output**  
  Capturing output from a running process using `StandardOutput` and `StandardError`.

- **Redirecting Input and Output**  
  Configuring process redirection for custom interaction.

- **Killing and Managing Processes**  
  Stopping and managing processes programmatically using `Process.Kill()` and `WaitForExit()`.

- **Asynchronous Process Execution**  
  Running processes asynchronously and handling events like `Exited`.

- **Practical Examples**  
  Real-world use cases, such as:
  - Running system commands (e.g., `ping`, `ipconfig`)
  - Launching an external application
  - Automating tasks with background processes
